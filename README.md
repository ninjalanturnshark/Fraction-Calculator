# Fraction-Calculator

A simple calculator designed for doing basic arithmetic with fractions (integers and floats can also be used). 

It can also determine boolean expressions.

I created this primarily as an exercise to understand how to work with numbers in python.

Any suggestions on improving the functionality would be much appreciated.
