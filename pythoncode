'''
this program should first accept an input of two fractions from the user

EG. 1/2 + 1/3

it should find the least common multiple of the denominator,

then convert the fractions to fractions with common denominators,

finally, it should carry out the specific arithmetic specified by the user and print the answer
'''

from fractions import Fraction

# these variables are what the user will enter as fractions

fraction1 = Fraction(input("First fraction: "))
op = input("Enter Operator: ")
fraction2 = Fraction(input("Second fraction: "))

# these are the conditions of the operator input

if op == "+":
    print(fraction1 + fraction2)
elif op == "-":
    print(fraction1 - fraction2)
elif op == "/":
    print(fraction1 / fraction2)
elif op == "*":
    print(fraction1 * fraction2)
else:
    print("invalid operator, please choose +,-,/,or *")
